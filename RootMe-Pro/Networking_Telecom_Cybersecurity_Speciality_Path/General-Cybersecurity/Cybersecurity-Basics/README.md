# Cybersecurity Basics Module Description:

# 📋 Overview
This module "introduces" me to the fundamental language and frameworks of cybersecurity. I am learning to navigate and understand key concepts, such as:

- How the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) works to assess the criticality of a vulnerability;
- How to identify and use CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) references to find information on publicly available vulnerabilities;
- How to understand the MITRE ATT&CK matrix to analyze attacker tactics and techniques.

Through this module, I am "learning" to be able to decipher cybersecurity technical terms and gain a better understanding of threats and vulnerabilities.
