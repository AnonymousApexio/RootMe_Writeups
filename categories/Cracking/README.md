# Cracking Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains writeups for the **Cracking** category challenges from RootMe. This category focuses on pure reverse engineering and binary analysis challenges. It was the original thing "crackers" used to do back in the early days of the Internet. 

## 🎯 What one learns doing those challenges
These challenges involve dissecting binary files to uncover low-level instructions that solve the presented problems. You'll work with various executable formats and learn to analyze compiled code to understand program behavior, find vulnerabilities, or recover hidden information.

## 🛠️ Required Skills
To successfully tackle these challenges, one should be familiar with:
- **Assembly languages** (x86, ARM, etc.)
- **Executable file formats** (ELF, PE, Mach-O, etc.)
- **Reverse engineering tools** (disassemblers, debuggers)
- **Binary analysis techniques**

## 🛠️ Software Analysis skills required
- Static and dynamic analysis
- Debugging and tracing
- Decompilation
- Patch analysis
- Anti-debugging bypass
- Code obfuscation reversal

## 📚 Challenge Types
The category includes challenges across various platforms and architectures:
- **ELF** (Linux binaries)
- **PE** (Windows executables) 
- **APK** (Android applications)
- **DotNet** assemblies
- **Mobile platforms** (Android, iOS)
- **Game platforms** (Godot, Unity, GameBoy)
- **Script bytecode** (Python, Lua, WASM)
