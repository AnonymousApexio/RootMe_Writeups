# App-Script Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains writeups for the **App-Script** category challenges from RootMe. This series of challenges confronts oneself with vulnerabilities related to environment weaknesses, configuration issues, and development errors in scripting or programming languages.

## 🎯 Challenge Category Description
The **App-Script** category focuses on exploiting weaknesses in various scripting environments and programming languages. These challenges typically provide login credentials, and the objective is to gain additional privileges by exploiting:

- **Environment weaknesses** (incorrect file permissions, weak encryption protection, etc.)
- **Development errors** in scripting languages
- **Configuration flaws** in system components

## 🛠️ Required Skills
To successfully complete these challenges, one should be familiar with:

- **UNIX shell environment** and command-line interfaces
- **Programming languages**: R, Python, Perl and such...
- **Binary file manipulation tools**
- **C/C++ programming language** concepts
- **System configuration** and privilege escalation techniques

## 📚 Challenge Types
This category includes various types of scripting and system challenges:

- **Bash** - System commands and shell vulnerabilities
- **Python** - Input validation, pickle serialization, format strings, and jail escapes
- **Perl** - Command injection vulnerabilities
- **PowerShell** - Windows command injection and SecureString
- **Docker** - Container escape and privilege escalation
- **LaTeX** - Input handling and command execution
- **PHP/JavaScript** - Language-specific jails and restrictions
- **System tools** - sudo, SSH, AppArmor, and shared objects

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
Through these challenges, I am learning:

- Scripting language security pitfalls
- Environment configuration weaknesses
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Input validation bypass methods
- Secure coding practices (by understanding insecure examples)
- System hardening concepts
