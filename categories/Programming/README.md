# Programming Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
The Programming category focuses on automating increasingly complex tasks to solve security challenges in seconds. These challenges require oneself to develop small scripts to address security problems, with the choice of programming language left to the user.

### 🎯 Challenge Category Description
**Prerequisites:** Mastery of a programming language

This category tests my ability to:
- Develop automated solutions for security problems
- Work with various encoding schemes and protocols
- Implement algorithms for mathematical sequences and cryptography
- Create shellcode and low-level programming solutions
- Interact with blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts
- Solve CAPTCHA and computer vision challenges
- Handle network protocols and data compression

### 🗂️ Challenge Types
The programming challenges encompass several domains:
- **Network Programming** - TCP protocols, data encoding, compression
- **Cryptography & Encoding** - Multiple encoding schemes, polynomial solvers
- **Shellcoding** - x64, x86, ARM architecture shellcode development
- **Blockchain** - Ethereum smart contract analysis and exploitation
- **Computer Vision** - CAPTCHA solving, adversarial attacks, deep learning
- **Web Automation** - Web scraping and interaction
- **Mathematical Algorithms** - Sequence solving, equation systems

### 🛠️ Recommended Skills
After analysis of these challenges, one should be comfortable with:
- At least one programming language
- Understanding of encoding schemes (base64, hex, rot13, etc.)
- Basic cryptography concepts
- Network socket programming
- Algorithmes and data structure basics
