# Cryptanalysis Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
Cryptanalysis challenges focus on uncovering secrets protected by various cryptographic systems, ranging from weak to strong encryption methods. These challenges test one's ability to break cryptographic protections through analytical thinking and mathematical approaches.

### 🎯 Challenge Category Description
In cryptanalysis challenges, you're presented with encoded or encrypted data, and the mission is to:
- Identify the type of encoding or encryption used
- Analyze the cryptographic weaknesses
- Recover the original plaintext through various attack methods

### 🛠️ Required Skills
To succeed in cryptanalysis challenges, you should be familiar with:
- **Common encoding formats** (Base64, Hex, ASCII, etc.)
- **Fundamental encryption algorithms** (AES, RSA, DES, etc.)
- **Hash functions** (MD5, SHA family, etc.)
- **Scripting languages** for automation and analysis
- **Cryptographic attack vectors** and mathematical foundations

### 🛠️ Common Techniques
These challenges often involve:
- Classical cipher breaking (Caesar, Vigenère, etc.)
- Modern cryptographic attacks
- Mathematical analysis of encryption systems
- Side-channel and implementation attacks
- Hash collisions and length extension attacks

### 🚀 Learning Objectives
By solving cryptanalysis challenges, I am trying to develop:
- A deep understanding of cryptographic principles
- The ability to recognize encryption patterns
- Skills in designing cryptographic attacks
- Knowledge of common implementation flaws
- Experience with cryptographic tools and libraries
