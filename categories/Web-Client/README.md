# Web - Client Challenges

## 📋 Overview
Welcome to the Web - Client challenges section! This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications that impact users or bypass client-side security mechanisms. These challenges confronts one with client-side scripting and programming languages, requiring them to analyze and understand scripts to find exploitable vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Required Skills
To successfully tackle these challenges, one should be familiar with:
- Client-side web scripting languages (primarily JavaScript)
- Browser debugging tools (Developer Tools, Firebug, JavaScript console)
- Web application fundamentals
- Basic understanding of web security concepts

## 📚 Challenge Types
This category covers various client-side vulnerabilities including:
- **JavaScript Analysis & Obfuscation** - Deobfuscating and understanding hidden code
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** - DOM-based, stored, and reflected XSS
- **CSP (Content Security Policy) Bypass** - Circumventing security policies
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** - Exploiting authentication mechanisms
- **DOM-based Vulnerabilities** - Manipulating Document Object Model
- **Client-side Authentication Bypass** - Breaking authentication logic
- **And many more...**

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
Through these challenges, I am learning:
- Understanding and exploiting client-side web application vulnerabilities
- Analyzing and reverse engineer client-side scripts (primarily JavaScript)
- Bypassing client-side security mechanisms
- Skills in identifying and exploiting front-end vulnerabilities
