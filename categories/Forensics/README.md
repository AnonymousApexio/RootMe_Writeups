# Forensic Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
Putting my digital investigation techniques to the test by analyzing memory traces, log files, network captures, and more...

Forensic challenges are designed to teach oneself the methodologies, techniques, and tools associated with digital investigation. This forensic science involves gathering evidence to understand the sequence of actions performed on or with an information system.

## 🎯 Challenge Category Description
This repository contains writeups for **forensic challenges** ranging from basic file recovery to advanced incident response scenarios. The challenges cover various aspects of digital forensics including:
- **Memory Analysis** - Investigating RAM dumps and volatile data
- **Log Analysis** - Parsing and interpreting system and application logs  
- **Network Forensics** - Analyzing packet captures and network traffic
- **File System Forensics** - Recovering deleted files and analyzing artifacts
- **Malware Analysis** - Investigating malicious software and indicators of compromise
- **Mobile Forensics** - iOS and Android device investigation
- **Windows Forensics** - Active Directory, LDAP, and Windows artifact analysis

## 🛠️ Forensic Domains
