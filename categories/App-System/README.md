# App-System Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains writeups for the **App-System** category challenges from RootMe. This series of challenges confronts oneself with application vulnerabilities primarily related to programming errors that lead to memory corruption.

## 🎯 Challenge Category Description
Login credentials are provided for the different challenges. The goal is to obtain elevated privileges by exploiting program weaknesses and thus obtain a password to validate each challenge on the portal.

## 🛠️ Required Skills
To successfully complete these challenges, one should be familiar with:
- **Common debuggers** (GDB recommended)
- **Debugging Methodologies**
- **Have basics in assembly language** (x86, x64, ARM, MIPS architectures)
- **Know C programming language** and memory management concepts
- **Understand exploitation mechanisms** of system vulnerabilities

## 📚 Covered Vulnerability Types
- **Stack buffer overflow** - Buffer overflow on the stack
- **Heap overflow** - Buffer overflow on the heap
- **Format string bugs** - Format string vulnerabilities
- **Use After Free** - Use of freed memory
- **Race conditions** - Concurrency issues
- **Return Oriented Programming (ROP)** - Advanced exploitation techniques
- **Binary hardening bypass** - Protection bypass techniques

## 🏗️ Architectures exploited
- **x86/x64** - Standard Intel/AMD architecture
- **ARM/ARM64** - Mobile and embedded architecture
- **MIPS** - Network and embedded architecture
- **RISC-V** - Modern open-source architecture
