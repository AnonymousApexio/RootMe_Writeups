# Network Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
This category focuses on practical network security challenges that teach one how to work with various networking protocols and services. These challenges cover everything from basic protocol analysis to advanced network manipulation techniques.

## 🛠️ Required Skills
- **Master a network analyzer** (Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.)
- **Knowledge of common protocols**:
  - Application layer (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, etc.)
  - Transport layer (TCP, UDP)
  - Network layer (IP, ICMP, ARP)
  - Data link layer (Ethernet)

### 🔧 Common Techniques
- Packet analysis and manipulation
- Protocol reverse engineering
- Authentication bypass
- Traffic interception
- Service exploitation
- Wireless network security

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
By doing these challenges, I am learning:
- Analyzing network traffic and protocols
- Understanding authentication mechanisms
- Manipulating network services
- Identifying and exploit network vulnerabilities
- Learning network forensic techniques
