# Steganography Challenges Writeups

## 📋 Overview
If cryptography is the art of secrecy, **steganography** is the art of concealment: the goal of steganography is not to make a message unintelligible to unauthorized individuals, but to make it go unnoticed.

## 🛡️ The Two Pillars of Steganography
Good steganography takes into account two essential factors:
- **[COMSEC (Communications Security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security)**
- **[TRANSEC (Transport Security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_security)**

## 🎯 Challenge Category Description
This category consist of finding information that has been hidden within computer data:
- 📸 **Images** (PNG, JPG, APNG, etc.)
- 🔊 **Sounds** (WAV, etc.)
- 🎥 **Videos**
- 📄 **Documents** (PDF, TXT, etc.)
- 🔧 **Miscellaneous Files** (ELF, metadata, etc.)

## 🛠️ Required Skills
- **Knowledge of data representation formats**
- **Proficiency in a scripting language** (Python, Bash, etc.)
- **Imagination** and good observation skills

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
Learning different steganography techniques:
- **EXIF Metadata**
